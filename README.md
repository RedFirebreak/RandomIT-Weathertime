# Henlo!

This is a project by or fiction-based company called "Random-IT". The gist of this project is to think of, make and present a real-world project/problem and present these to 'actual' clients as a solution for their IT infrastructure.

The following project includes:

- An interactive front-end for clients
- A admin portal (backend OR protected front-end)
- A data collector / scraper
- Some means of storing and filtering usefull data

We, "Random-It" are hyped to get started and are very eager to deliver an actual project for a fake company.
